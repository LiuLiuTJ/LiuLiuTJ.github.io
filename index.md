Welcome to my academic homepage. 

For the past five years, I have been working on **Digital Twin City**, **RSSI–based crowd analytics**, and **AI for Urban Planning**.

As the Principal Investigator, I am conducting several projects including: *Integrated Technology for 'Sensing – Simulation – Planning Response' of Cultural Heritage Risk*, *Performance Evaluation and Optimization Method of Community Renewal Planning Supported by AI and Digital Twin*, and *Real-time Obstacle-Avoidance Navigation Method for Indoor Crowd Modeling Based on Wi-Fi Positioning and an Improved Two-level Pathfinding Approach*.
