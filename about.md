I am a senior researcher and expert in Geographic Information Science and Geomatics, with long-term research focused on innovative technologies and applications for integrated indoor–outdoor planning, based on digital twins and intelligent sensing. In recent years, I have been dedicated to interdisciplinary studies on spatial planning informatisation in the context of digital transformation. 

I have also been engaged in the field of urban planning for a considerable period of time. I am passionate about programming and about uncovering the underlying patterns within cities. Consequently, my current research primarily focuses on advancing intelligent urban development and digital governance, which necessarily involves the appropriate application of cutting‑edge technologies.
