### 1) Uncertainty of indoor human trajectories for precise navigation
- Goal: quantify and minimize trajectory uncertainty under complex indoor layouts.
- Methods: ABM + GNN, visibility voxels, probabilistic routing.

### 2) Wiâ€‘Fi RSSI + infrared counters for high-density crowd monitoring
- Goal: early warning for congestion with minimal sensors.
- Methods: local GPR per visibility cell, transfer learning, digital twin.

### 3) Community renewal impact evaluation via multi-objective optimization
- Goal: policy-aware design recommendations balancing livability and access.
- Methods: graph-based design space, RL for scenario search.
